Each exercise adds onto the next with 5 exercises in this given assignment.

Exercise 1: https://editor.p5js.org/cyprian.dove/sketches/JOteO-MTV -- In this assignment I create a Finch character from a modified bird sprite with rounded wings and cute features to slide across a tundra ground. The Finch follows mouseX, and stays on its axis of finchY.
Exercise 2: https://editor.p5js.org/cyprian.dove/sketches/XqI2nTERn -- My Finch catcher gains an extra sprite when the mouse is pressed down as to open its mouth to the sky to catch the red seed.
Exercise 3: (https://editor.p5js.org/cyprian.dove/sketches/qZHM-Kcqm) -- A seed falls once from the drop of any key and from the sky.
Exercise 4: https://editor.p5js.org/cyprian.dove/sketches/GUGApVeAx -- The seed is modified to reset every time it hits the ground at a certain Y level.
Exercise 5: https://editor.p5js.org/cyprian.dove/sketches/tnnkM5g3y -- I felt like I got really close with this assignment, and it was to change the sprite when there was a change in detection. Everything else was prepared, but I cannot seem to get the detection part to operate with the rest of my assignment. The syntax appears to be correct, but the code is not registering.
